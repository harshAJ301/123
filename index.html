    <h1>Hi Sunshine ☀️</h1>
    <p>🌟 I want to say something. It might feel slightly eerie for you, but I know I’d regret it if I didn’t. So, I finally worked up the courage to put it into words. 💖</p>
    <button onclick="beginMessage()">💌 Begin</button>
    <p>Do you believe in love at first sight? 💘</p>
    <button onclick="askLoveQuestion()">Yes</button>
    <button onclick="askLoveQuestion(false)">No</button>
    <p id="message" style="margin-top: 20px;"></p>

    <script>
        function askLoveQuestion(isYes = true) {
            let message = document.getElementById("message");
            if (isYes) {
                message.innerHTML = "💕 Well, that's the story of mine. When I first saw you in 9th grade, I didn’t like you—obviously, I didn’t know you much beyond your name. But when I truly got to know you, maybe around the end of 10th, I realized there was something special about you. 💫<br><br> 😍 When I got to know your sense of humor, your kindness, and so much more about who you are, I realized there’s something truly special about you. Over time, those little things grew into something I couldn’t ignore. 💕<br><br> Sometimes, it’s hard to keep this inside, and I’ve been scared that saying it might change things between us. But I really like you. I know you might not feel the same way—maybe you even hate me—but I wanted to be honest because you mean so much to me. ❤️<br><br> 🌈 Thank you for everything you’ve unknowingly added to my life. You’ve made it brighter in ways I can’t explain. ✨<br><br> 🎉 And one last thing—Happy Birthday! 🎂 If you feel like yelling at me, laughing, or saying anything at all, just drop me a voice note… I’ll be waiting. 😊🎙️❤️<br><br> Let’s end this with a note:<br><br> <em>"Her beauty struck me much later, it’s true, <br>But first, I fell for the soul that shone through." 💖</em>";
            } else {
                message.innerHTML = "😅 Ab tho maan le, itne log apko propose kar chuke hain—I am also one of them! 💕";
            }
        }
