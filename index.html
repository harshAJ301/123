    <h1>Hi Sunshine ☀️</h1>
    <p>I want to say something. It might feel slightly eerie for you, but I know I’d regret it if I didn’t. So, I finally worked up the courage to put it into words.</p>
    <button onclick="beginMessage()">Begin</button>

    <script>
        function beginMessage() {
            let response = confirm("Do you believe in love at first sight?");
            if (response) {
                alert("Well, that's the story of mine. When I first saw you in 9th grade, I didn’t like you—obviously, I didn’t know you much beyond your name. But when I truly got to know you, maybe around the end of 10th, I realized there was something special about you.\n\nWhen I got to know your sense of humor, your kindness, and so much more about who you are, I realized there’s something truly special about you. Over time, those little things grew into something I couldn’t ignore.\n\nSometimes, it’s hard to keep this inside, and I’ve been scared that saying it might change things between us. But I really like you. I know you might not feel the same way—maybe you even hate me—but I wanted to be honest because you mean so much to me.\n\nThank you for everything you’ve unknowingly added to my life. You’ve made it brighter in ways I can’t explain.\n\nAnd one last thing—Happy Birthday! 🎉 If you feel like yelling at me, laughing, or saying anything at all, just drop me a voice note… I’ll be waiting. 😊🎙️❤️\n\nLet’s end this with a note:\n\n\"Her beauty struck me much later, it’s true,\nBut first, I fell for the soul that shone through.\"");
            } else {
                alert("Ab tho maan le, itne log apko propose kar chuke hain—I am also one of them! 😅");
            }
        }
